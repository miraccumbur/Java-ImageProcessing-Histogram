Firstly I ran jpgToTxt class. This operation  is for jpg to txt for image. In this class firstly create jpg file and output txt file in originalImage folder. I created new BuffereadWriter and OutpuStreamWriter. Then, I create a if structure for control to this file already exists. And created this file. Then ,I used imageIo read method for read jpg . And get width height. After that, I wrote type width height and max value in txt file. Then I created two for loop.This for read all pixels. I read that and get red, blue and green. And wrote this in txt file.

Now I explain second part. In main class I created a main method.Firstly I get txt name. After I create new scanTxtFile class. In this class I read txt file like homework 2. After that in main method I get width and height. Especially I get pixels for original image array. Then I created grayscale class.In this class i created
createGrayScale method.  I called this method in main class main method.And send pixelsforOriginal array, width and height. In createGrayScale method create a new pixels array.Then I create  tho for loop and read every pixel.Red value multiplied .2126,green value multiplied .7152 and blue value multiplied .0722 .İn main method I get that pixels and I created pixelsForGryascale array. I created binaryImage class and createBinary method.I sent width height and again pixelsForOriginal array in  this method .In this method I read pixels like grayscale and I get average pixels red, green, blue values. If this average value small 127 0,else 1. I create pixelsForBinary in main method . Then I created vertical class. I sent width height and pixelsforbinary array . I read pixels and I create a counter if value equals to 0 counter++. And this value create every column for vertical histogram.In horizontal class similar to vertical but this not column this is for each row.In border class I created two method and ran these.In createHorizontalBorder I read pixels and I control value equals 0 with if structure. In this structure if column equals 0 just control next value.If next value is 1 in new array value is 25500.If this pixels in last column just control previous value.If this are not true control previous and next value.İIn creatVerticalBorder method like that but in this for row not column. Then in main method I created a jFrame and JTabbedPane. I created drawingPanelFor3Byte class for original image, drawingPanelFor2Byte for grayscale image and binary image. And add these tab1,tab2,tab3 in JTabbedPane. In drawingPanelForVertical and drawingPanelForHorizantal I used drawline method and created histogram.This class get two array.First one is pixelsForOriginal other one pixelsForBorder. And I controlled for every pixels if pixels border value equals 25500 setColor 255,0,0(red) and show this in that pixels.Else I showed pixelsForOriginal pixels.And Finally add JTabbedPane to JFrame.
